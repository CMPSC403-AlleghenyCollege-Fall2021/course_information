### Description

Credits: 4

A study of the principles used in the design, implementation, and evaluation of secure computer hardware and software. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students assess the trade-offs in security policies and create software with efficient and effective security mechanisms. Leveraging insights and tools from an industry partner, students also investigate techniques for providing access control, secure channels, and intrusion detection. During a weekly laboratory session students use advanced security software to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

Prerequisite: CMPSC 201.

Distribution Requirements: QR, SP.

### Objectives

Current world of pervasive technology and big data demands all systems to be secure to allow flawless practices. This course introduces students to the fundamental principles of computer security, focusing on topics on both the defensive and offensive side of security. Areas of discussion include, but are not limited, to security design principles, systems security and exploitation, access control and authentication, secure channels, network security, language-based security, privacy and anonymity, and intrusion detection. The main goal of the course is to equip students with the knowledge and skills to tackle security challenges and to develop appropriate solutions to those challenges. Students will learn how to both think adversarially with respect to computer systems as well as how to reason about defenses and attacks.

The course will introduce students to the theory and practice of computer security while covering both the well-established and the cutting-edge areas of the discipline. The course also invites students to assess the reliability of their implementations and conduct both analytical and empirical evaluations of the performance of various systems with respect to security while considering their social, political, and ethical implications. Moreover, the course will ask students to implement small- and medium-scale intelligent systems and to use a wide variety of relevant AI tools. In addition to improving their teamwork skills, students will enhance their ability to write and speak about secure systems in a clear and concise fashion.

### Outcomes

By the completion of this course, a student must be able to:

- Examine and apply the fundamental techniques of computer security.
- Demonstrate knowledge of security objectives and policy development. 
- Identify, explain, and resolve security issues in computer systems following the process of scientific inquiry. 
- Design, implement, and test secure software.
- Interpret numeric security-related data and their graphical representations.
- Communicate the human role in security systems with an emphasis on social, political, legal and ethical vulnerabilities.

#### Class activities

All students are required to actively participate during all of the class sessions. During nearly all class sessions, you will be required to complete and submit class activities (individually and in teams).

#### Presentations

At various points of the course, students will engage with learning "hot topics" and investigative reporting, results of which they are invited to present to class.

#### Reflection quizzes

At the beginning of each class session (starting on week 2), students will be invited to take a short quiz reflecting on their understanding of the reading material.

#### Lab assignments

Lab assignments will contain challenges that incorporate specific course concepts. Lab assignments will feature individual or team work, and are graded on completion, completeness, and correctness. 

#### Course project

Course project provides students with an opportunity to develop a reasonably complex student-created project. Completion of this project will require use of the knowledge accumulated throughout the semester and will require planning, careful evaluation, and implementation of a wide variety of concepts.

#### Assignment submission

All assignments have a stated due date and are to be turned in electronically on that due date. By submitting each assignment a student pledges that they have complied with Allegheny Honor Code. You must follow assignments instructions for submitting your completed programs in order for them to be graded.
Late assignments will be accepted for up to one week past the assigned due date with a 15% penalty. All of the late assignments must be submitted at the beginning of the session that is scheduled one week after the due date. Unless special arrangements are made with the course instructor, no assignments will be accepted after the late deadline.

#### Attendance

It is mandatory for all students to attend all of the class and laboratory sessions. There are two types of excused absences: 1) the one you notify the instructor about in advance (for example, if you have a job interview during the class/lab time or have a religious observance), 2) the one that occurs due to a documented emergency or illness. If you will not be able to attend a session, please let the instructor know at least two days in advance to describe your situation. In case you missed a class because of an emergency or an illness, please notify the instructor as soon as possible. In both cases the instructor will work with you to get you caught up. Students who miss more than five unexcused sessions will have their final grade in the course reduced by one letter grade. If you need to miss class due to a religious observance, please speak to me in advance to make appropriate arrangements.

#### Communication

Various digital channels are used in this course for communication, including email, Discord, and the GitHub issue tracker. Additionally, the course website is used to store the link to the course GitHub Organization, which will contain course syllabus, course schedule and the assignments. Students are responsible for regularly checking all platforms to ensure that the important messages are not being missed.

#### Allegheny College statement of community

Allegheny College also expects students and faculty to act according to its Statement of Community:

> Allegheny students and employees are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful and safe residential learning community that will actively confront and challenge racism, sexism, heterosexism, religious bigotry, and other forms of harassment and discrimination. We encourage individual growth by promoting a free exchange of ideas in a setting that values diversity, trust and equality. So that the right of all to participate in a shared learning experience is upheld, Allegheny affirms its commitment to the principles of freedom of speech and inquiry, while at the same time fostering responsibility and accountability in the exercise of these freedoms. This statement does not replace existing personnel policies and codes of conduct.

Keep both of these standards in mind as you exercise your academic inquiry in this course. These serve as our fundamental "first principles" in pursuit of our shared academic goals.

#### Honor code

All students and faculty at Allegheny College are bound by the Honor Code. Everyone expects that your behavior reflects this commitment. Given the eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the Department of Computer Science adds the following statement to the general college policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers, student assistants, and fellow students.  Such dialogue is encouraged.  However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else’s work.  It will therefore be understood that all assignments submitted to faculty of the Department of Computer Science are to be the original work of the student submitting the assignment, and should be signed in accordance with the provisions of the Honor Code.  Appropriate action will be taken when assignments give evidence that they were derived from the work of others.

As the nature of "plagiarism" and constituents of "fair use" change often, the department encourages you to periodically review the specific tenets of the general college Honor Code provided in the latest course catalog and in the _Compass_.

The above statement, of course, also applies to online forums such as Stack Overflow, et al.

#### Classroom ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its members to act according to discipline-specific ethics. I encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) [Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).

### Assistance

#### Assistance with course concepts

Students who struggle to understand knowledge and skills defined in this course are encouraged to seek assistance from the course instructor.
