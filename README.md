### Description

Credits: 4

A study of the principles used in the design, implementation, and evaluation of secure computer hardware and software. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students assess the trade-offs in security policies and create software with efficient and effective security mechanisms. Leveraging insights and tools from an industry partner, students also investigate techniques for providing access control, secure channels, and intrusion detection. During a weekly laboratory session students use advanced security software to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

Prerequisite: CMPSC 201.

Distribution Requirements: QR, SP.

### Objectives

Current world of pervasive technology and big data demands all systems to be secure to allow flawless practices. This course introduces students to the fundamental principles of computer security, focusing on topics on both the defensive and offensive side of security. Areas of discussion include, but are not limited, to security design principles, systems security and exploitation, access control and authentication, secure channels, network security, language-based security, privacy and anonymity, and intrusion detection. The main goal of the course is to equip students with the knowledge and skills to tackle security challenges and to develop appropriate solutions to those challenges. Students will learn how to both think adversarially with respect to computer systems as well as how to reason about defenses and attacks.

The course will introduce students to the theory and practice of computer security while covering both the well-established and the cutting-edge areas of the discipline. The course also invites students to assess the reliability of their implementations and conduct both analytical and empirical evaluations of the performance of various systems with respect to security while considering their social, political, and ethical implications. Moreover, the course will ask students to implement small- and medium-scale intelligent systems and to use a wide variety of relevant AI tools. In addition to improving their teamwork skills, students will enhance their ability to write and speak about secure systems in a clear and concise fashion.

### Outcomes

By the completion of this course, a student must be able to:

comfortable with the fundamental theory and practical techniques in artificial intelligence and be aware of the current research in the area. Stu- dents should be able to recognize new problems that may be solved using artificial intelligence methods and implement a complete application that uses them to solve the stated problem. Stu- dents must develop and apply a strong knowledge of analytical and empirical techniques that they can use to characterize and predict the performance of intelligent systems. Finally, students should be comfortable discussing and arguing the philosophical, ethical, social and political issues
surrounding intelligent systems.

- Examine and apply the fundamental techniques of computer security.
- Demonstrate knowledge of security objectives and policy development. 
- Identify, explain, and resolve security issues in computer systems. 
- Design, implement, and test secure software.
- Communicate the human role in security systems with an emphasis on social, political, legal and ethical vulnerabilities.

#### Allegheny College Statement of Community

Allegheny College also expects students and faculty to act according to its Statement of Community:

> Allegheny students and employees are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful and safe residential learning community that will actively confront and challenge racism, sexism, heterosexism, religious bigotry, and other forms of harassment and discrimination. We encourage individual growth by promoting a free exchange of ideas in a setting that values diversity, trust and equality. So that the right of all to participate in a shared learning experience is upheld, Allegheny affirms its commitment to the principles of freedom of speech and inquiry, while at the same time fostering responsibility and accountability in the exercise of these freedoms. This statement does not replace existing personnel policies and codes of conduct.

Keep both of these standards in mind as you exercise your academic inquiry in this course. These serve as our fundamental "first principles" in pursuit of our shared academic goals.

#### Honor Code

All students and faculty at Allegheny College are bound by the Honor Code. Everyone expects that your behavior reflects this commitment. Given the eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the Department of Computer Science adds the following statement to the general college policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers, student assistants, and fellow students.  Such dialogue is encouraged.  However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone elseâ€™s work.  It will therefore be understood that all assignments submitted to faculty of the Department of Computer Science are to be the original work of the student submitting the assignment, and should be signed in accordance with the provisions of the Honor Code.  Appropriate action will be taken when assignments give evidence that they were derived from the work of others.

As the nature of "plagiarism" and constituents of "fair use" change often, the department encourages you to periodically review the specific tenets of the general college Honor Code provided in the latest course catalog and in the _Compass_.

The above statement, of course, also applies to online forums such as Stack Overflow, et al.

#### Classroom ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its members to act according to discipline-specific ethics. I encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) [Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).

### Assistance
